Description: My project is a digital logic simmulator/editor where users can place NOR gates and draw connections between them to create all manor of digital circuitry. Users may save their designs to the server and browse/search through other designs that have been made. The bulk of this project was done with javascript, implementing the engine of the simmulation along with helpful editing tools like copy/paste and undo/redo.

Files Created:
    Django files: Mainly auto generated django project files.
    capstone.html: The project's html.
    capstone.css: The project's styling.
    capstone.js: The project's scripts.
    models.py: Model of the design so that user's designs may be saved to a db.
    urls.py: Routing for the project.
    views.py: Various django views to handle the client server interaction. 

Justification: As a simmulator, it's unlike any of the other projects I have completed in this course. This project incorporates many of the principles and techniques discussed in this course plus a a large number I had to research and discover myself. More than just this project's higher number of code lines written, it exceeds the previous projects in thinking done per line as well.
